# Git Push Instructions for Till Closing System

Since there were issues with the automated git commands, here are the manual steps:

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
git init
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 2: Add Remote Repository
```bash
# Replace with your actual repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
# OR for GitLab
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

## Step 3: Add Files to Git
```bash
# Check what files are modified
git status

# Add specific files we modified
git add pos/close_till.php
git add include/db.php
git add include/functions.php

# OR add all files
git add .
```

## Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement comprehensive till closing system with anti-theft features

- Added dedicated close_till.php with full UI and functionality

- Updated database schema with new shortage fields

```

## Step 5: Push to Remote Repository
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main

# OR if using master branch
git push -u origin master

# OR if branch name is different
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```
